# FTL
This the repository of the Formal Template Language (FTL) [1, 2], a formal language for expressing templates of any textual language. FTL has a general mathematic semantics, not being bound to any platform or execution environment. FTL is generative; it describes the form of possible sentences of some target language and generates specific sentences when provided with an instantiation.

FTL has had the following applications:

* Transform UML models into Z specifications [2, 3].
* Generate monitoring specifications for security monitoring [4]
* transform UML class models into Alloy [5].
* translate service-level agreements into monitoring specifications for monitoring [6].
* Generate multi-platform code for mobile application from platform-independent models [7].
* Produce Z database representations from templates [8].
