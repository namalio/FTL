# FTL
This the repository of the Formal Template Language (FTL) [1, 2, 3], a formal language for expressing templates of any textual language. FTL has a general mathematic semantics, not being bound to any platform or execution environment. FTL is generative; it describes the form of possible sentences of some target language and generated specific sentences when provided with an instantiation.
